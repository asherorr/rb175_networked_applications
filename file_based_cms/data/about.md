# Introduction to Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented:** Everything in Ruby is an object, even numbers and booleans.
- **Readable Syntax:** Ruby code is designed to be easy to read and write.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Types are checked at runtime, not in advance.
- **Metaprogramming:** Ruby can modify its own structure and behavior while running.

## Example Code

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
