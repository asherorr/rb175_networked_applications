# Introduction to Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.  
It was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the mid-1990s.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented:** Everything in Ruby is an object, even numbers and booleans.
- **Readable Syntax:** Ruby code is designed to be easy to read and write.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Types are checked at runtime, not in advance.
- **Metaprogramming:** Ruby can modify its own structure and behavior while running.

## Common Uses

Ruby is widely used for:
- Web development (especially with the Ruby on Rails framework)
- Scripting and automation
- Data processing
- Prototyping and teaching programming concepts

## Example Code

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
